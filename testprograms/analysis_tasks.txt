## Task 1: Time/Accuracy performance on a task
## Data set: data/data_0.csv
## Use T-tests and any other tests you think would be appropriate
## Tasks: 
# Compare the time between groups A and B 

# Compare the accuracy between groups A and B 

## Task 2: System performance
## Data set: data/timing.csv
## Background: There are three strategies that may affect system performance: naive, caching, and forking. 
## Programs are run with program variants
## Programs are run multiple times (hence there are multiple "runs")
## Tasks: 
# Do the strategies vary across runs? Compare each strategy across runs

# How do the strategies compare to one another?
