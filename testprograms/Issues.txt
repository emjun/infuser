Infuser issues
	lambda functions
	list comprehension: python library calls like str(x) or list(v)
	field assignments: df.some_col = som_var, doesn't work
	DataFrame creation routines (compare algorithm_comparison.py)
	pandas concat function is not supported yet. That actually arises quite often


fixed:
	operator +=
	Constant values: True, False, None
	basic list comprehension works now
