Infuser issues
	lambda functions
	list comprehension: python calls inside list comprehensions, e.g. str(x), list(a)

	field assignments: df.some_col = som_var, doesn't work
	DataFrame creation routines (compare algorithm_comparison.py)
	pandas concat function is not supported yet. That actually arises quite often


fixed:
	operator +=
	Constant values: True, False, None
	list comprehension basics
